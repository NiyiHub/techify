                    a. The first 6 weeks are designed to offer a foundational preparation <br>that will cover any deficiencies you may have before you go into your program, And if you've got a tech background but it's gathering rust, <br>we've got refresher courses that will whip you into shape and fix the knowledge gaps.<br>

We'll happily refer you to try other programs and them come back when you've completed their program. We expect 100% of unserious candidates<br> to be unable to complete the program.
